## Key Components

### 1. Email Clients
- Desktop applications (Outlook, Thunderbird)
- Web-based clients (Gmail, Yahoo)
- Mobile apps

### 2. Email Servers
- SMTP servers for sending
- POP3/IMAP servers for receiving
- Email storage systems

### 3. Protocols
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- POP3 (Post Office Protocol)
- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

{% include callout.html type="note" title="Protocol Choice" content="IMAP is generally preferred over POP3 as it keeps emails synchronized across multiple devices." %}

## Email Security

### Authentication Methods
- SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

### Common Threats

## Email Journey Overview

When you send an email:

1. **Composition**
   - Write email in client
   - Add attachments if needed

2. **Sending**
   - Client connects to SMTP server
   - Authentication occurs

3. **Routing**
   - DNS lookup for recipient domain
   - MX record determines destination

4. **Delivery**
   - Recipient's server accepts email
   - Security checks performed
   - Message stored for retrieval
